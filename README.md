The Bot Playground

A semester-long class project for Phil 190, Spring 2016, at UC Merced

An experimental application that allows us to create simple bots with their own distinctive personalities, AI, etc.

To use it, just download and open botPlayground.html in a browser (fFrefox seems to work well, it does not work on Chrome).
