The Bot Playground

A semester-long class project for Phil 190, Spring 2016, at UC Merced

An experimental application that allows us to create simple bots with their own distinctive personalities, AI, etc.

To use it, clone this repo, run a local server e.g `python3 -m http.server 8000` and then open using `http://localhost:8000/botPlayground.html`
