# The Bot Playground

Code associated with a semester-long project for a small honors course offered in Spring 2016 at UC Merced, Phil 190, "Philosophy of Game Programming". It was an experimental course that was only offered that one semester, but it was a blast to teach and illustrates what I think is a promising idea.

Each student was responsible for their own bot and had their own folder where they could add logic and graphics to their bot. Each week we added new functionality. It was presented as being mostly unrealistic, but a good way to just learn various skills and ideas. 

Topics included 
- "Freudian state machines"
- Production systems and goals
- Memory and Perception
- Knowledge Bases
- Utility Functions
- Reinforcement Learning

It was so much fun! Each week the students would see their bots get a little more interesting. By the end it was a pretty wacky place. Our code was by no means perfect (just run it and see for yourself), but as a teaching method, I thought it was incredibly effective. Not sure how well it would scale to larger groups, but I can see potential... 

# How to run the code
Clone this repo, then run a local server, for example using `python3 -m http.server 8000` 

Open in a local browser using `http://localhost:8000/botPlayground.html`
